In JavaScript, elements are selected from the DOM either as a single element or as a collection. Methods like getElementsByClassName() always return a collection (HTMLCollection) because a class can be used by multiple elements, so even if only one element exists you must access it using an index like [0], which means the first matching element in the document order. You cannot apply .style directly to a collection, only to an individual element. querySelector() works differently: it uses CSS selectors and directly returns the first matching element, which is why it feels simpler and does not need [0]. If multiple elements share the same class, querySelector() will always select the first one unless you make the selector more specific using parent elements, IDs, or event context. In short, JavaScript does not guess your intention—you must explicitly tell it which element you want.
